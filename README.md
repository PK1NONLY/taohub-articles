What is in here?

## FAQ
Frequently asked questions go here. If your answer is pretty long with lots of examples consider making it an article instead.

## Articles
An article is every document that explains a certain feature of TAO. The preferred place for such articles is the wiki of the respective extension. There will obviously be cases where multiple extensions are concerned or where you feel for whatever reason that an article doesn't belong in the wiki. In these cases it goes in here.

## By Repository
Readme articles and wiki articles fetched from the different tao extension repositories.

## Forge
We have a large number of documents that have previously been published on the TAO Forge. We will need to weed through them and sort out legacy and ever unfinished stuff. Many of them will need to be moved to an extension wiki, others will end up in the article directory.

## Resources
Every directory has a sub-directory called _resources_ for pictures etc.
