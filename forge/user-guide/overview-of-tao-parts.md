Overview of TAO parts
=====================



*This section briefly presents the seven parts that constitute TAO.*

TAO is structured in independent parts to permit a flexible and versatile use of the platform:

![](../resources/1-1-schema.png)

![](../resources/1-1-items.png) [Items](../user-guide/items.md)
----------------------------

This part manages the creation and design of items and exercises.<br/>

Different design templates are proposed depending on the type of item you want to create.

![](../resources/1-1-tests.png) [Tests](../user-guide/tests.md)
----------------------------

This part manages the test creation. You can create a test by combining a selection of Items into a Test.<br/>

You can also configure the test parameters: item order, scoring, layout, etc.

![](../resources/1-1-testtakers.png) Test takers
---------------------------------------

In this part, you can define who your test taker(s) are and manage their registration data.<br/>

It also allows associating the selected test taker to the relevant group(s).

![](../resources/1-1-groups.png) [Groups](../user-guide/groups.md)
------------------------------

This part manages the groups creation, i.e., grouping test takers according to global features and classifications.<br/>

You can assign the selected groups to the delivery(ies).

![](../resources/1-1-deliveries.png) [Deliveries](../user-guide/deliveries.md)
--------------------------------------

This part manages the test deliveries.<br/>

The delivery creation is the process of assigning selected tests, and group(s) to a delivery campaign.<br/>

At this stage, it is possible to exclude test taker(s) from the delivery apart from their group membership.<br/>

You can also edit a set of properties: sequence, maximum number of executions, delivery period, etc., and define a delivery campaign.

![](../resources/1-1-results.png) [Results](../user-guide/results.md)
--------------------------------

This part gives results of all delivered tests with their referring Test takers, Groups and Items specific data, as well as the individual data collected during Test execution.<br/>

Here you can create tables to visualize the results and then export them for further data analysis.

![](../resources/1-1-processes.png) [Processes](../user-guide/processes.md)
------------------------------------

This part is optional.<br/>

It manages the process creation and allows you to build processes to drive activities into workflow.
