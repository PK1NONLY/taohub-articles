The main functions of this tab are:

-   Tests library
-   Actions in Tests|Actions
-   Edit test class
-   Select related items
-   Items sequence
-   Test properties
-   Translate in Tests|Translate

2. Advanced authoring tool
--------------------------

The Tests Advanced authoring tool tab is only available if you installed Processes part.<br/>

This tab permits to create a complex list of items.<br/>

Indeed, without the Processes tab, it is only possible to create tests with a sequential list of items.
