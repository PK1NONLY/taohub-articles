Kohs
====

![](../resources/kohs-authoring.png)<br/>
The Kohs editor is displayed when a Kohs item is selected in the Items library box and when you click on the Authoring button in the Edit item box or on the Authoring tab.

The authoring of a Kohs-test offers a square with nine fields (left side) and six cubes with different designs (right side).

Clicks on one of the cubes to select it and then on the field(s) where it should be positioned.

After all fields are filled a check mark will appear. Click on it to save the pattern. Your Kohs item is ready for testing.
