C-Test
======

![](../resources/ctest-authoring.png)

The C-Test editor is displayed when a C-Test item is selected in the Items library box and when you click on the Authoring button in the Edit item box or on the Authoring tab.

To create a C-Test you have to write the text into the text field. Mark (double click) the appropriate word to obtain automatically a gap.

There is one parameter to define, it is the time allowed to fill in the gaps. The test taker won’t be able to access a following text before the specified time has expired.

Apply your changes by clicking on the Save button.
