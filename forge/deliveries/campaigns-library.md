Campaigns library
=================

![](../resources/campaigns-library.png)

The Campaigns library provides a tree-view of the Campaigns ![](../resources/Campaign_icon_library.png) and classes ![](../resources/class_icon_library.png) you have created. All are contained in the “Delivery Campaign” root class.

You can move campaigns in order to change their belonging class by drag and drop, or with the “Move” icon.

Different actions are available by right clicking (edit, new class, new campaign, move, duplicate, delete) depending on whether a class or a campaign is selected.

You can filter the Campaigns library. Only the campaigns and classes labels that meet the string enter in the text field will be displayed.
