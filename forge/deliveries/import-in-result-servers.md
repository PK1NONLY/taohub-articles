Import
======

![](../resources/resultservers-import1.png)

-   The Import box is displayed when a class is selected in the Result servers library and when you click on the Import action.
-   You can import your data to CSV or to RDF.
-   If you choose to import your data to CSV, the import is occurring in three steps: first define the common options of your CSV file, second select your file in your file system by clicking the Browse button and thirdly map the columns of your CSV file to the properties of your class.
-   If you choose to import your data to RDF, you must indicate the RDF item you want to import.
