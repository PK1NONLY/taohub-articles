Adaptive Testing Work Group
===========================

The goal of this work group is to extend TAO to drive adaptive tests.

Useful informations
-------------------

-   **Coordinator**: Joel Bout: joel@taotesting.com
-   **Mailing list**: adaptive-testing@taotesting.com

Process
-------

A very early tentative draft

### Preparation

-   A tutorial on how to create a custom [[testrunner]].
-   Create a state-full example of a test runner implementation

### Definition

-   Create interface for response retrieval
-   Define a common set of properties to be used as [[psychometric item model]]
-   Define interface for CAT algorithms

### Implementation

-   Create abstract CAT extension
-   Implement individual CAT runners

### Harmonisation

-   Compare diffrent implementation in order to identify common components
