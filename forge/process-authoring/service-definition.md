Service definition
==================

-   The Service definition box defines the services that will be integrated into an activity.
-   The services are shared with every delivery which is in advanced mode, e.g. modifying a service definition will affect every delivery that is using it.<br/>

    ~~Question : modification aussi dans processes et deliveries ? en attente de réponse~~
    ~~En attente de la documentation développeur~~
